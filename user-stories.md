### 1. Document Uploading and Processing

These stories cover the initial interaction of getting the document into the system.

* **As a User,** I want to select and upload a PDF file from my computer, **so that** the system can process it for questioning.
* **As a User,** I want to see a visual confirmation (e.g., a loading bar or "Processing...") while the system is parsing and vectorizing the PDF, **so that** I know the system is working and I don't close the window.
* **As a User,** I want to receive a clear notification when my document is successfully processed and ready, **so that** I know I can begin asking questions.
* **As a User,** I want to be alerted with an error message if the file upload fails (e.g., it's not a PDF, it's corrupted, or too large), **so that** I can try again with a valid file.

### 2. Querying the Document (RAG)

These stories define the core Q&A interaction, emphasizing the Spanish language requirement.

* **As a User,** I want to type a question in a text input box, **so that** I can request specific information from my document.
* **As a User,** I want to ask my questions in **Chilean Spanish** and have the system understand the nuances of my language, **so that** I can interact naturally and get accurate results from the Spanish document.
* **As a User,** I want the answers generated by the system to be **directly based** on the information present in the uploaded PDF, **so that** I can trust the answers are factual and contextually relevant.
* **As a User,** I want to receive answers in clear, coherent Spanish, **so that** the information is easy to understand.
* **(Optional but recommended): As a User,** I want the system to provide **citations** (e.g., page or section references) with its answers, **so that** I can easily locate and verify the source information in the original PDF.

### 3. Handling Out-of-Scope Questions

This section covers the requirement to guide the user when a query isn't relevant.

* **As a User,** if I ask a question that **cannot** be answered by the document's content, I want the system to inform me that the information is not available, **so that** I am not misled by a fabricated (hallucinated) answer.
* **As a User,** when my question is off-topic or irrelevant, I want the system to politely **ask me to rephrase** or ask another question that is related to the document, **so that** I am guided back to a productive conversation.
